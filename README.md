# DevOps Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of DevOps projects that showcase the use of various tools for infrastructure automation, configuration management, monitoring, and container orchestration.

## Tools & Technologies

The following tools are used in these projects:

- **Linux**: For scripting, automation, and system management.
- **AWS Cloud**: For provisioning cloud infrastructure.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to automate cloud infrastructure setup.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management for automated server setup and orchestration.
- **Grafana**: Visualization tool for monitoring and dashboard creation.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting tool.
- **Node Exporter**: To collect system metrics for Prometheus.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging and deploying applications.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
