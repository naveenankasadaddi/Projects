### The prometheus.yml file is the main configuration file for Prometheus. It defines settings for scraping metrics from targets, configuring alerting rules, and setting up remote write/read integrations. Key sections include scrape_configs to specify the endpoints Prometheus should scrape, alerting for defining alerting mechanisms, and rule_files to load custom alert rules. Adjusting prometheus.yml allows you to control how Prometheus monitors systems and applications.
