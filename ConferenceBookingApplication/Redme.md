The Conference Booking Application is a Go-based program designed to manage ticket bookings for a conference with a total capacity of 50 tickets. Users can provide their first name, last name, email, and the number of tickets they wish to book. The application validates the input, processes bookings, and keeps track of the remaining tickets dynamically. It also ensures that the total number of tickets sold does not exceed 50. This project demonstrates key concepts in Go such as user input handling, data validation, and state management.
