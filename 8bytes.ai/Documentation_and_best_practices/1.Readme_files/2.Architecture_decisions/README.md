# **Architecture Decisions in DevOps Engineering Projects**

This document outlines the architecture decisions made in the project from a DevOps engineering standpoint. These decisions are based on best practices in scalability, security, automation, and observability.

## **1. Infrastructure Design**

Decision: Cloud-first (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
Rationale: Offers managed services, global scalability, and cost-effective pricing. Enables automation via APIs and better disaster recovery.

Alternatives Considered: On-premise or hybrid cloud
Trade-off: Increased maintenance and slower scaling capabilities.

## **2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Decision: Terraform (or Pulumi/CloudFormation)
Rationale: Enables version-controlled, reproducible infrastructure. Supports multi-cloud provisioning and remote state management.

State Management: Remote backend (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB lock for Terraform)
Reason: Ensures consistency and prevents conflicts in team environments.

## **3. Containerization**
Decision: Docker
Rationale: Containers provide consistency across environments, fast provisioning, and ease of packaging complex applications.

## **4. Orchestration & Scalability**
Decision: Kubernetes (K8s)
Rationale: Enables container scheduling, scaling, self-healing, and service discovery. Vendor-agnostic and ideal for microservices.

Alternative: ECS, Docker Swarm
Reason for Rejection: Less flexibility or vendor lock-in.

## **5. CI/CD Pipelines**
Decision: Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
Rationale: Automates testing, builds, and deployments. Supports rollback strategies, security scans, and approval workflows.

- Features Included:
  Trigger on PR/merge

- Automated tests

- Vulnerability scans (Trivy, Snyk)

- Auto-deploy to staging

- Manual gate for production

## **6. Security & Secrets Managemen**
Decision: Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Kubernetes Secrets
Rationale: Centralized, auditable, and encrypted secret storage. Integrates with CI/CD pipelines and RBAC.

## **7. Monitoring & Observability**
Decision: Prometheus + Grafana
Rationale: Prometheus scrapes metrics from exporters, Grafana visualizes dashboards. Alertmanager handles alerting.

Metrics Tracked:
System health (Node Exporter)

App metrics (Custom exporters)

Database metrics (MySQL/Postgres exporters)

Request/latency/error metrics

## **8. Logging**
Decision: ELK Stack / Loki + Grafana
Rationale: Centralized logging across containers and servers. Helps with root cause analysis, debugging, and audits.

## **9. Notifications & Incident Management**
Decision: Slack, PagerDuty, Email integrations
Rationale: Provides real-time feedback on deployments, alerts, and failures. Reduces MTTR and improves visibility.

## **10. Environment Strategy**
Decision: Multi-stage (Dev → Staging → Prod)
Rationale: Segregation improves safety, testing, and rollback confidence. Separate namespaces/clusters used.

## **11. Artifact Management**
Decision: Docker Hub / ECR / Artifactory / Nexus
Rationale: Version-controlled, secure artifact storage for container images, binaries, and packages.

## *12. Backup & Disaster Recovery**
Decision: Snapshot-based EBS/RDS backups + S3 archival
Rationale: Ensures data durability and business continuity. Automated scheduling and testing of restore procedures.

## **13. Cost Optimization**
Practices:
Right-sizing compute instances

Auto-scaling policies

Reserved instances for production

Spot instances for dev/test

S3 lifecycle policies

## **14. Change Management**
Decision: GitOps / PR-driven changes
Rationale: All infra/app changes must go through peer-reviewed, auditable pipelines. Reduces configuration drift and manual errors.
