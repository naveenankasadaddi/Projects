### 3. Architecture

A high-level overview of our infrastructure architecture is provided below. For detailed diagrams, please refer to the `docs/architecture` directory.

**(Example Description - Replace with your actual architecture)**

Our infrastructure is deployed in `[Cloud Provider, e.g., AWS]` within the `[Region, e.g., us-east-1]` region. It consists of:

* **VPC/Virtual Network:** Segmented into public and private subnets.
* **Public Subnets:** Hosts Load Balancers and Bastion Hosts.
* **Private Subnets:** Contains application servers (EC2 instances/EKS nodes), database instances (RDS/Aurora), and internal services.
* **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic to application servers.
* **Managed Database Service:** For persistent data storage.
* **Object Storage:** For static assets and backups.
* **Container Orchestration (Optional):** EKS/AKS/GKE cluster for containerized workloads.

* `environments/`: Contains environment-specific Terraform configurations (dev, staging, prod).
* `modules/`: Contains reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure components (VPC, EC2, RDS, etc.).
* `ansible/`: Contains Ansible playbooks and roles for configuration management and application deployment.
* `scripts/`: Utility scripts for common tasks.

#### Environment Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-org/your-infrastructure-repo.git](https://github.com/your-org/your-infrastructure-repo.git)
    cd your-infrastructure-repo
    ```
2.  **Configure Cloud Provider Credentials:**
    Ensure your chosen cloud provider's CLI is authenticated and configured with the necessary permissions.

    * **AWS:** `aws configure` (or set environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`).
    * **Azure:** `az login`
    * **GCP:** `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`

3.  **Terraform Backend Configuration:**
    Each environment's `backend.tf` file is configured to use a remote backend (e.g., S3 for AWS, Azure Blob Storage for Azure, GCS for GCP) to store the Terraform state. **DO NOT store state files locally for production environments.**

    * **Example S3 Backend (environments/dev/backend.tf):**
        ```terraform
        terraform {
          backend "s3" {
            bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
            key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
            region         = "us-east-1"
            encrypt        = true
            dynamodb_table = "your-terraform-state-lock"
          }
        }
        ```
    * **Ensure the backend resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, etc.) are created manually or via a separate, minimal Terraform configuration if they don't already exist.**

#### Deployment Steps

1.  **Navigate to the desired environment directory:**
    ```bash
    cd environments/dev # or staging, or prod
    ```
2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    This command downloads necessary providers and initializes the backend.
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
3.  **Review the Plan:**
    This command shows you what Terraform will create, modify, or destroy. **Always review the plan carefully.**
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars" # If using a .tfvars file
    ```
    * Consider using `terraform validate` to check syntax before planning.
4.  **Apply the Changes:**
    This command applies the changes defined in the plan to your cloud infrastructure. You will be prompted to confirm.
    ```bash
    terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars" # If using a .tfvars file
    ```
    * For automation in CI/CD, use `terraform apply -auto-approve`.
5.  **Run Configuration Management (e.g., Ansible):**
    After Terraform provisions the infrastructure, use Ansible to configure instances, deploy applications, etc.
    ```bash
    cd ../../ansible
    ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_app.yml -i inventory/dev_inventory.ini --private-key=/path/to/your/ssh/key.pem
    ```
    * The inventory file (`dev_inventory.ini`) should be dynamically generated from Terraform outputs or a cloud inventory plugin.

**Destroying Infrastructure (Use with EXTREME CAUTION!):**

To destroy all resources managed by Terraform in a specific environment:

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

# 5. Key Components and Technologies
- `Cloud Provider`: [e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP]

- Infrastructure as Code:

    - Terraform: For provisioning and managing core infrastructure resources.

    - Ansible: For configuration management, software installation, and application deployments.

- Compute:

    - [e.g., AWS EC2 instances, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine]

    -[e.g., Amazon EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]

    - [e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions]

- Networking: VPCs/VNets, Subnets, Security Groups/NSGs, Load Balancers, Route 53/Azure DNS/Google Cloud DNS.

- Storage: [e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage] [e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disks, Google Persistent Disk]

- Databases: [e.g., AWS RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL), Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas]


# 6. Networking
Detailed network configurations, including VPC layouts, subnet CIDR ranges, routing tables, and security group rules, are defined within the modules/vpc and environment-specific main.tf files.

- Public Subnets: For internet-facing resources (Load Balancers, NAT Gateways).

- Private Subnets: For application servers, databases, and internal services, with no direct internet access.

- NAT Gateways/Instances: Enable outbound internet access for private subnets.

- VPC Peering/VPN: (If applicable) For connectivity to other VPCs or on-premises networks.

- Security
Security is paramount and is baked into our infrastructure design:

- IAM (Identity and Access Management): Least privilege principle applied to all roles and users accessing cloud resources. IAM roles are used for EC2 instances/Kubernetes nodes.

- Security Groups/Network Security Groups (NSGs): Strict ingress/egress rules for all resources.

- Data Encryption:

- At Rest: Databases, S3 buckets, and EBS volumes are encrypted.

- In Transit: SSL/TLS is enforced for all external and internal communication where sensitive data is exchanged.

- Secrets Management: Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) are stored securely using services like [AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager] and retrieved at runtime. Never hardcode secrets in code.

- Regular Security Audits: Automated scans and manual audits are performed periodically.

8. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting
We use the following tools to ensure the health and performance of our infrastructure:

- `Monitoring:`

[Cloud Provider Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring]: For collecting infrastructure metrics.

Prometheus & Grafana: For collecting application and custom metrics, and creating interactive dashboards. (See docs/monitoring/grafana_dashboards.md for dashboard details).

- `Logging:`

[Centralized Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Datadog]: For aggregating logs from all services and instances.

[Cloud Provider Logging: CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs, Google Cloud Logging]: For collecting native cloud logs.

`Alerting:`

Configured in [Cloud Provider Monitoring Tool] and/or Prometheus Alertmanager.

Alerts are sent to [e.g., Slack channel #ops-alerts, PagerDuty, email group].

Refer to docs/monitoring/alerts_configuration.md for alert definitions.

# 9. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Our strategy for data protection and business continuity:

Database Backups: Automated daily backups of [Database Type] instances to [Storage Location] with a retention period of [X days/weeks]. Point-in-time recovery is enabled.

- Volume Snapshots: Regular snapshots of critical EBS volumes/Azure Disks/Google Persistent Disks.

- Object Storage Versioning: Enabled for critical S3 buckets/Azure Blob Containers/GCS buckets.

- Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:

    - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): [e.g., 4 hours]

    - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): [e.g., 15 minutes]

We utilize a [Pilot Light / Warm Standby / Multi-Region Active-Active] strategy in [DR Region].

Regular DR drills are performed [e.g., quarterly]. (See docs/dr_plan.md).

# 10. Cost Management
We actively monitor and optimize our cloud spending:

- Resource Tagging: All provisioned resources are tagged with Project, Environment, and Owner for cost allocation.

- Cost Monitoring: We use [Cloud Provider Cost Explorer/Azure Cost Management/Google Cloud Billing Reports] to track spending.

- Right-Sizing: Regular reviews of resource utilization to right-size instances.

- Reserved Instances/Savings Plans: Utilized for predictable, long-running workloads.

- Automated Shutdowns: Non-production environments are automatically shut down during off-hours to save costs.

# 11. CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment of both application code and infrastructure changes.

- Tool: [e.g., GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps Pipelines]

- Pipeline Stages (for Infrastructure):

- Code Commit: Changes pushed to main or feature branches.

- Linting & Formatting: Ensures code quality.

- Terraform Plan: Generates and reviews the execution plan (often requires manual approval for prod).

- Terraform Apply: Applies infrastructure changes.

- Ansible/Configuration Management: Configures instances and deploys applications.

- Automated Tests: Post-deployment tests (e.g., smoke tests, integration tests).

- Notifications: Status updates sent to relevant channels.

# 12. Troubleshooting
Terraform Apply Failures:

- Check terraform plan output for unexpected changes.

- Review provider documentation for resource-specific errors.

- Consult cloud provider logs (CloudTrail, Activity Logs, Audit Logs) for API call failures.

- Verify IAM permissions.

- Connectivity Issues:

- Check Security Groups/NSGs and Network ACLs.

- Verify routing tables and subnet configurations.

- Ensure instances have correct IP addresses and DNS resolution.

Application Deployment Issues:

- Review application logs.

- Check Ansible playbook logs for errors during configuration.

- Verify resource availability (CPU, memory) on instances.



# 13. summary
Setting up infrastructure involves planning and designing based on application needs, then using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to automate provisioning. Running it requires continuous efforts in networking, security, and managing compute, storage, and databases. Critical aspects include CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments, robust monitoring and logging for visibility, and a solid backup and disaster recovery plan. Ultimately, it's about creating a scalable, secure, and resilient environment with automation at its core.
