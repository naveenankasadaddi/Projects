# **Cost Optimization Measures**
This document outlines strategies and practices implemented to control and reduce cloud and infrastructure costs without compromising reliability, performance, or security.


## **1. Infrastructure Sizing & Right-Sizing**
What: Select appropriate instance sizes (CPU, memory, storage).

How:

Use monitoring data (CPU/memory usage) to right-size EC2, RDS, etc.

Remove underutilized or idle resources.

Avoid overprovisioning by leveraging auto-scaling.

## **2. Auto Scaling**
What: Dynamically scale compute resources based on load.

How:

Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in Kubernetes.

Use EC2 Auto Scaling Groups with CloudWatch metrics.

Scale down to 0 in dev/test environments during non-working hours.

## **3. Spot Instances & Reserved Instances**
Spot Instances: For non-critical or fault-tolerant workloads (e.g., batch jobs, CI runners).

Reserved Instances: For predictable long-running production workloads (up to 72% cost savings).

## **4. Storage Optimization**
### **S3:**

Use lifecycle policies to archive old data to Glacier or delete it.

Enable Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost savings.

### **EBS:**

Identify and delete unattached volumes.

Use gp3 instead of gp2 for cost efficiency.

## **5. Network Cost Control**
Use VPC endpoints instead of public NAT gateways.

Minimize cross-region traffic.

Compress data and cache aggressively (CDNs).

## **6. CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**
Optimize pipeline execution:

Avoid unnecessary builds on every commit.

Cache dependencies and Docker layers.

Clean up old artifacts regularly.

Schedule runners to shut down when idle (for self-hosted runners).

## **7. Container Resource Limits**
Set CPU and memory limits in Kubernetes to prevent resource hogging.

Use limit ranges and quotas to restrict namespace resource usage.

## **8. Scheduled Shutdowns**
Use automation (Lambda, cron jobs, or SSM) to shut down:

Dev/QA EC2 instances

EKS node groups

Database instances outside business hours

## **9. Monitoring and Cost Visibility**
Tools Used:

AWS Cost Explorer, CloudWatch, Prometheus

Grafana dashboards for resource usage

Practices:

Set budget alerts

Enable cost allocation tags

Track usage by team/project/department

## **10. Avoid Resource Leaks**
Automate deletion of:

Orphaned volumes, load balancers, IPs

Old snapshots and AMIs

Unused DNS records and endpoints

## **11. Use Managed Services Judiciously**
Compare cost vs effort for managed vs self-hosted (e.g., RDS vs self-managed DB).

Use serverless (Lambda, Fargate) for bursty workloads.

## **12. Governance & Policies**
Enforce policies using:

Terraform + OPA (Open Policy Agent)

AWS Service Control Policies (SCP)

Limit region access, service types, instance sizes
